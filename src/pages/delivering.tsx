                    <h2 className='text-lg font-bold text-primary pb-4'>2. Key Components of Logistics</h2>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'>a. Transportation: The movement of goods is the foundation of logistics. Whether by road, air, sea, or rail, selecting the appropriate mode of transportation is crucial for timely deliveries and cost-effectiveness. </p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'> b. Warehousing: Warehouses serve as temporary storage hubs, allowing businesses to store inventory and manage fluctuations in demand. An effective warehouse layout and inventory management system can significantly improve logistics efficiency</p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'>c. Inventory Management: Maintaining optimal inventory levels is a delicate balancing act. Excess inventory ties up capital, while inadequate stock leads to stockouts. Advanced inventory management systems and just-in-time (JIT) practices can help strike the right balance. </p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'> d. Information Technology: In today&apos;s digital age, logistics heavily relies on sophisticated software and data analytics. Supply chain management systems enable real-time tracking, route optimization, and demand forecasting.</p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'> e. Supply Chain Partnerships: Collaborating with reliable partners, such as carriers, suppliers, and distributors, fosters trust and enhances the overall efficiency of logistics operations.</p>
