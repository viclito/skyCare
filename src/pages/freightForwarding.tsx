                    <h2 className='text-lg font-bold text-primary pb-4'>What is Freight Forwarding?</h2>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6'>Freight forwarding is a specialized service that facilitates the transportation of goods from the point of origin to the final destination. Freight forwarders act as intermediaries between shippers (manufacturers or exporters) and carriers (shipping lines, airlines, trucking companies) to ensure that cargo reaches its intended location efficiently and cost-effectively. These professionals have an in- depth knowledge of transportation regulations, documentation, and logistics, making them indispensable partners for businesses engaged in global trade.</p>

                    <h2 className='text-lg font-bold text-primary pb-4'>The Role of Freight Forwarders:</h2>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'>1. Documentation and Compliance: Freight forwarders handle a multitude of paperwork required for international shipments, including customs documentation, bills of lading, and certificates of origin. They ensure compliance with regulations and assist with clearing customs in different countries, avoiding potential delays or penalties.</p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'>2. Transportation Management: Freight forwarders choose the most suitable transportation mode (air, sea, rail, or road) based on factors like cost, time constraints, and the nature of the cargo. They also negotiate with carriers to secure the best rates for their clients.</p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'> 3. Cargo Insurance: Freight forwarders can arrange cargo insurance to protect against potential damages or losses during transit. This provides peace of mind to shippers, knowing their goods are safeguarded.</p>
                    <p className='text-sm font-medium leading-6 pb-2'>4. Consolidation and Deconsolidation: For smaller shipments, freight forwarders can consolidate goods from multiple suppliers into a single larger shipment, reducing costs. On the receiving end, they also deconsolidate shipments, distributing individual consignments to their respective destinations.</p>
